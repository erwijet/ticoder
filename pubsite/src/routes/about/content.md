# TiCoder 

If you have a question that isn't answered here, or are at all curious about anything else, feel free to [reach out](mailto://tyler@holewinski.dev).

## Motivation

The purpose of TiCoder is to provide a tool to students to encourage and kindle an interest in programming. By employing a block-based program editor, we provide
students a way to build programs without worrying about the underlying technical details of typical programming.

Additionally, an [open source tibasic lexer/compiler](https://crates.io/crates/tibrs) was developed as well to eliminate the need for students to download Texas Instruments propritary softwareâ€” which often times would be simply incompatible with chromebooks or other low-powered student devices.
